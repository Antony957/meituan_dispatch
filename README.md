# Meituan Work Experience (Professional Projects)

During my time as a **Software Engineer at Meituan (2022â€“2023)**, I contributed to the design and
implementation of **large-scale distributed systems**, focusing on **real-time data processing, applied AI
integration, and scalable backend platforms**. My work involved building systems that supported **billions of
mobility events daily**, improving operational efficiency and enabling robust model experimentation pipelines.

The following three case studies highlight my contributions:

1. **ðŸš– Dispatch Playback System**  
   Designed and delivered a large-scale playback and visualization platform to reconstruct dispatch flows
   and bike trajectories. Optimized storage and retrieval of billions of GPS logs using **Kafka, HBase, and Presto**,
   reducing manual diagnostic workload by ~5,000 hours annually.

2. **ðŸ§ª Model Experiment Platform**  
   Built a **simulation and A/B testing framework** for evaluating 100+ dispatch strategies under realistic
   mobility scenarios. Leveraged **distributed computing, real-time replay engines, and statistical evaluation
   pipelines** to ensure stable production rollouts of new models.

3. **ðŸ“Š Data Pipeline for Model Training**    
   Implemented a high-throughput data ingestion pipeline using **Flink, HBase, and Hive**, processing
   10M+ logs daily. Delivered scalable training/evaluation datasets for algorithm teams, shortening model
   tuning cycles by 16% and improving group ROI by 25%.
